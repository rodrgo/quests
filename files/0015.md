## üëÅÔ∏è¬†About Cyclops

Cyclops is a tool for managing Kubernetes clusters, offering a streamlined and user-friendly GUI experience for developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals. It simplifies Kubernetes configuration with intuitive web forms and graphical representations, making the deployment and management of containerized applications easier. It also allows developers and DevOps teams to create bespoke Helm charts for deploying any application with any requirements.

### üèÅ¬†How do I start?

Cyclops is a very easy and intuitive tool. However, the concepts and background knowledge required to get a good grasp of it can be quite complex if you‚Äôre not acquainted with Kubernetes. Don't worry, we'll hand-hold you through the basic concepts so you can experience it for yourself. If you know your Kubernetes, go to the Advanced Track section.

- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes**
    
    Kubernetes, or K8s, is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications. It uses key concepts like Pods, Services, Deployments, and Ingress to ensure applications are scalable, portable, and resilient. **Pods** are the basic units that run containers; **Services** provide load balancing and service discovery; **Deployments** manage application updates; and **Ingress** handles external access to services.
    
    Kubernetes automates tasks such as container scheduling, health monitoring, and resource allocation, improving efficiency and reducing manual work. It supports microservices architecture, allowing different parts of an application to be deployed and managed independently. Kubernetes also offers self-healing by automatically replacing failed containers and optimizing resource use. Its active community and extensive ecosystem provide additional tools and extensions, making it a powerful solution for modern application development and deployment.

    - [kubernetes basis tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
    
- üê≥ **Docker**
    
    Docker is an open-source platform designed to simplify the development, shipping, and deployment of applications by using containerization technology. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker provides tools to create, manage, and orchestrate these containers, ensuring they run consistently across different environments, from a developer‚Äôs local machine to production servers. By isolating applications in containers, Docker enhances portability, consistency, and efficiency, allowing developers to build once and run anywhere. This approach significantly reduces conflicts between different environments and streamlines the software development lifecycle.
    
    In essence, Docker is primarily used for container creation and packaging, while Kubernetes provides tools for container orchestration, managing multiple containers across multiple hosts, and ensuring applications are running efficiently and reliably in production environments. Often, Docker is used in conjunction with Kubernetes: Docker to create containers and Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage them.
    
    Lastly, here are some useful links that will help you get the gist of Docker in a more hands-on manner:
    
    - [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-overview/)
    - [Docker hub instalation](https://docs.docker.com/guides/getting-started/get-docker-desktop/)

    - [containerize an aplication](https://docs.docker.com/guides/workshop/02_our_app/)
      
- ‚éà **Helm charts**
    
    Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you manage Kubernetes applications. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications with ease. Helm uses charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to define the structure and configuration of your application.
    
    **Helm Charts** are essentially Kubernetes YAML manifest files bundled together into a single package. They define all the resources needed to run an application on Kubernetes, including deployments, services, ingress rules, config maps, and more. Helm Charts provide a way to version, share, and reuse Kubernetes applications, making it easier to deploy applications consistently across different Kubernetes clusters. Charts can be customized through templating using Helm's built-in templating engine, allowing you to parameterize values and configurations to suit different environments or use cases. Overall, Helm and Helm Charts simplify the management of Kubernetes applications by encapsulating complex Kubernetes configurations into reusable and shareable packages.
    
    Helm templates are a powerful feature that allow you to customize Kubernetes manifest files within Helm Charts. Helm uses the Go templating engine to dynamically generate Kubernetes YAML files based on your configuration and input values.
    
    Here‚Äôs how Helm templates work:
    
    1. ***Templating Engine***: Helm templates use Go's text/template and sprig libraries to enable dynamic content generation. This means you can use conditional logic, loops, variables, and functions within your Kubernetes YAML files.
    2. ***Values File***: Helm allows you to define values in a `values.yaml` file or pass them directly via the command line. These values can be referenced within your templates to customize the generated Kubernetes resources.
    3. ***YAML Files***: Within a Helm Chart, each Kubernetes resource (like deployments, services, config maps) is typically defined in a separate YAML file in the `templates/` directory. Helm processes these files, applies the templating logic, and renders them into fully realized Kubernetes manifest files.
    4. ***Parameterization***: Helm templates support parameterization, allowing you to define placeholders (e.g., `{{ .Values.image.repository }}`) that are substituted with actual values during deployment. This makes Helm Charts flexible and reusable across different environments.
    5. ***Reuse and Composition***: Helm templates encourage reuse and composition. You can create reusable components (partials) and include them in multiple places within your templates, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
    
    Cyclops has [some specific documentation](https://cyclops-ui.com/docs/templates/) for their Helm charts/templates, so be sure to give them a thorough read. You don't have to forcibly create your own chart for this quest, as Cyclops provides some demo templates. Here are some other useful links:
    
    - [HELM docks](https://helm.sh/docs/)
    - [tips and tricks](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/)
    - [templates getting started](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)
    
- üßä¬†**Minikube**
    
    Minikube is a tool that allows you to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally on your machine. It's designed for developers and Kubernetes enthusiasts who want to test and develop applications using Kubernetes without needing access to a full-scale cluster. Minikube provides a sandbox environment where you can deploy and manage Kubernetes applications, explore different configurations, and test compatibility‚Äîall isolated from your main operating system. It's straightforward to set up and use, making it convenient for local development and experimentation with Kubernetes features before deploying applications to larger-scale production environments.
    
    Minikube will be the cornerstone of this quest unless you have another preferred k8s cluster to work on. If you wish to work on Minikube, you can follow the installation guide [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download). Also, here are some useful links:
    
    - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
    - [Minikube controls](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/controls/)
    - [Cyclops kubectl install](https://cyclops-ui.com/docs/installation/install/manifest)
    
    With this you should now be able to very make your way on this quest. 
    
- üëã **Cyclops Hello World**
    
    Now that you have the basic information to use Cyclops to its fullest, you can delve straight into it. You‚Äôll now learn how you can deploy an application using Cyclops and explore Cyclops' tools to monitor your deployment and your k8s cluster. To do so, follow these steps:
    
    1. ***Get yourself a K8s cluster***: This can be any k8s cluster, but the easiest one to use for this will be [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download).
    
    2. ***Install Cyclops on your cluster***: To do so, follow the installation [guide](https://cyclops-ui.com/docs/installation/prerequisites) provided by Cyclops.
    
    3. ***Get yourself an application***: Here is where you need to begin to explore and understand k8s, Docker, containerisation, and Cyclops. You have two options:
    
        - Create an app from scratch for this quest.
        - Use an app that you have submitted to a previous quest.
       
       Note that both apps need to meet two requirements: (1) Have a UI (it can be as simple as you wish), (2) Be able to be interacted with on `localhost:8881`.
    
    4. ***Containerise your application and push to Docker Hub***: To do so, follow Docker's containerisation [tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/guides/workshop/02_our_app/). There are other great tutorials out there like this [one](https://dev.to/aahil13/how-to-containerize-an-application-with-docker-3i8m). Once your application is containerised, you will be able to push it to Docker Hub by following the Docker Hub [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/guides/workshop/04_sharing_app/).
    
    5. ***Deploy using Cyclops***: Now get the Cyclops GUI running on [localhost](http://localhost/). Once done, navigate over to the **modules** section, click on **add new module**, and select the **demo** template. You will be presented with a screen like this:
      
       ![new module page.jpg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a8bb25df-0bb7-49ae-b3bb-6496fd5b7326/561de738-6318-408e-a0f4-c685b6b60a06/new_module_page.jpg)

       After your service has successfully been deployed, port-forward it through the command line:
    
        ```bash
         kubectl port-forward svc/<app-name> <wanted-port>:<target-port>
        ```
    
        for example:
    
        ```bash
         kubectl port-forward svc/my-app 8881:80
        ```
    
       Once this has been done, it should successfully deploy your application on port `8881` of `localhost`.
       Note that the port can be changed. Cyclops shows the demo templates on port 80 by default. Since that is the default, the above `kubectl port-forward` command may not work. If that is the case, change it to any desired port.
    

Congratulations! You are now hopefully more knowledgeable in a lot of different topics. Now you can get started on the quest ‚öîÔ∏è
