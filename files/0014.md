## 🌋 The Challenge

We have different challenges available, depending on your level of experience.

### Beginner track

Develop a simple webapp (for example, a To-Do list manager) where different types of users (e.g., admin, guest) have distinct access rights. A video with an example can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Zm2FPfrh8&list=PLAvd37Z6WimsQOnp9Ai0wz6n2eJrUtymo), a use-case project that uses OPAL and Cedar can be found [here](https://www.permit.io/blog/scaling-authorization-with-cedar-and-opal). _You can use a previous Quest submission to achieve this._ _*Some Tips*_:

- Keep the policy models very simple in the project application, and demonstrate the ability to synchronize policies and data.
- Besides OPA as a policy engine, OPAL also supports AWS Cedar as a policy engine. The Cedar language is way simpler than the OPA Rego. You can find a detailed example of a blog system that uses OPAL and Cedar here - https://github.com/permitio/opal-cedar and here - https://www.permit.io/blog/scaling-authorization-with-cedar-and-opal.

### Medium track

One of the main powers of OPAL is the _data-fetcher mechanism_, which also allows the synchronization of data and policies. The medium track challenge consists of writing data fetchers to fetch data from external data sources into OPAL.

Permit.io is eager to get creative implementations of data fetchers to OPAL. Focusing on the data fetching aspect will solve the problem of writing complex policies and will actually help Permit's roadmap. Permit actually thinks that data fetchers are relatively easy to implement 😇.  

👉 Here's the documentation of data fetchers: [https://opal.ac/tutorials/write_your_own_fetch_provider](https://opal.ac/tutorials/write_your_own_fetch_provider)

👉  Here's a code sample for Postgres and CosmosDB data fetchers: [permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres) and [avo-sepp/opal-fetcher-cosmos](https://github.com/avo-sepp/opal-fetcher-cosmos)

👉 Write a GraphQL data fetcher that allows users to fetch data into their policy engine in real time.


### Advanced track

These projects are actually in Permit's roadmap 🤯

- A k8s controller that will allow to deploy OPAL as part of the k8s platform.
- Develop a webapp where users' karma and location affect their permissions to perform operations (for example, a recipie sharing app). Fetch this data dynamically from a MySQL server (requires both a data fetcher and an example project).
- Write a documentation page that shows real-world use cases of OPAL with detailed examples.


## 💰 Claiming the loot 

To claim badges or rewards,

1. Your app must subscribe to the requirements of any of the tracks above.

3. Your project must have a README. Your README must clearly explain what the project does and how someone can run it or install it. Video demos are definitely helpful in helping the judges understand your project!

4. Please create a video (maximum 5 minutes long) to explain how your project uses Permit, or just illustrating the user journey that Permit enabled. Upload the video to YouTube and paste the link in the _YouTube_ field when you upload your repo. 

5. The content you submit to the quest must be original code.

6. Teams **are not allowed** for this Quest.

7. Each individual can only submit one repo. If you make a mistake, you have to remove the repo and upload a new one.

8. If you build on top of an existing repo, you must be the owner of the repo.
